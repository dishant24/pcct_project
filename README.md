## Photon Counting CT Energy Level Conversion Using Diffusion Model

This project proposes an innovative solution for Photon Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) energy level conversion utilizing a diffusion model to enhance tissue characterization. 
By generating different energy level translations through advanced diffusion models, we aim to improve the diagnostic quality of medical imaging.

Goals :
1. Improve Diagnostic Quality: Enhance the clarity and resolution of medical images to aid in more accurate diagnoses.
2. Optimize Tissue Contrast: Generate high-contrast images to better differentiate between various tissue types.
3. Ensure Practical Applicability: Work closely with medical professionals to ensure that our solutions are useful and relevant in clinical settings.
